# My Wordpress Stuff

> _I found myself spending a lot of time doing the same tasks, but customized to different websites. The plugins here are aimed at reducing the time spent on those tasks._

> _I have actively been trying to move away from using Child themes, and getting closer to custom theme development. Jumping straight into custom themes from child themes is a pretty big change, so I am using the Underscores starter theme as a transition to that, and used the "Sassify" option to include a basic Sass setup in the generated theme._

> _I found that a good deal of my time developing child themes was spent overwriting someone else's style rules, and throwing `!important` tags everywhere in places where the old rules took priority over mine. So the Underscores themes are aimed at reducing some of that irrelevant code._

## A Code Above theme
### A Wordpress theme built with Underscores

I originally created a child theme for the Twenty Thirteen Wordpress theme, then recreated it using the Underscores starter theme. (http://underscores.me/)

All of the graphics are custom on this site. FYI, I am not a graphics person, but I do enjoy doing it sometimes.

## Add Footer Widget Area

So I created this as a plugin, but it doesn't work standalone, because in order to load the new widget area, the theme's files must be modified to load that widget area. 

It does, however, remove a step where you would normally have to modify functions.php or create custom-functions.php

## Contact Widget
##### Work in Progress

When written, will be a simple, lightweight widget to display contact information. The location will open native map applications on mobile devices. (I have utilized this before, but not yet in a Wordpress plugin)

## Hours Widget
##### Work in Progress

When written, will be a simple plugin to display business hours, formatted to be responsive, to remove

## My Super Simple Contact Form
### An HTML 5 Contact Form

I like to utilize the new standards and features as much as I can. In HTML 5 several new input types were added, and I wasn't able to find any existing Wordpress plugins that utilize them.

Most of the other contact form plugins (that I tried) were also bloated, or packaged with other plugins, like in Jetpack. This one is currently hard-coded to my email address. This is a brand new plugin, and I haven't yet modified it for reusability.
